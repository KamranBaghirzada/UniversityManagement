# UniversityManagement
This is an application written with Servlet and JSP technologies. Although I have started to learn Spring Framework for development of web applications, it is appropriate to know in depth, how Java actually works with servlets, and handles with requests and responses in web applications. So that, I decided to develop such application. The application is about student and management data manipulation including their registration, deletion, updating and saving new ones. It worths no note that, it helped me a lot when I had started Spring Framework - CRUD operations.
# Used technologies
Apache Tomcat (9.0.69 version) - Web Server, Java Servlets - for handling requests and responses, JSP - for UI.
